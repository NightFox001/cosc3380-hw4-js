IMPORTANT!!!
When accessing our webapp, you will be asked to sign-in or create a new account with a name, email, and password (This is how we keep track of what bookings each 'customer' has) it is VERY IMPORTANT that you do not use your real email and password as they will be store in our 'customers' table and visible to us. 


There are two ways to use our web app; We set up a website on our on server so all you have to do is copy and past the website link below, or you can run the webapp locally.



1. main website, copy this link into your browser:
http://76.226.74.200:3000/login
There is no need to run or install anything. This also allows for communication between other clients too!! 



2. local install:
- download the hw4.zip
- extract it
- Run visual studio code on the root directory (the HW4 folder) OR cd into root with mac / linux terminal
- Inside the HW4 folder/directory, run the following commands in the terminal/command prompt
	1. npm install
	2. npm run dev

You should be able to access the website with this url:
http://localhost:3000/login

This is totally independent from the website
